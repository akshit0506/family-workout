// This is an *optimistic* check only (reads the session cookie, doesn't hit
// the database) — it exists to redirect signed-out visitors before any page
// renders, for UX, not as the security boundary. The real enforcement is
// RLS + fetchCurrentAthlete() throwing with no session (see
// lib/data/supabase-helpers.ts and FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md): even if a route
// somehow rendered without this check running, it couldn't read or write
// anything meaningful without a valid session.
// Sign-in is pure OTP-code entry (verifyOtp) from a single client-rendered
// page — no separate callback route to allow-list.
//
// Also public: PWA plumbing that must be fetchable with no session at all.
// /manifest.webmanifest is what the browser reads to decide installability
// — redirecting it to an HTML login page instead of JSON breaks that
// entirely. /sw.js is registered via a plain fetch
// (navigator.serviceWorker.register) that expects a JS response, not a
// redirect. /offline is precached by the service worker itself at install
// time — if that fetch got redirected to /login, the cache would end up
// storing the login page under the /offline key instead of the real one.
