-- Family Workout — DEVELOPMENT seed (local dev only)
--
-- This file is for local development and testing ONLY. It is never used in
-- production — `supabase db push` (the command that deploys migrations to a
-- hosted project) does not run any seed file, and this one specifically is
-- wired up only via `supabase/config.toml`'s `[db.seed] sql_paths`, which
-- local `supabase db reset`/`supabase start` read and a hosted project
-- never does. Production instead uses `supabase/production_bootstrap.sql`,
-- a deliberately separate, much smaller file — see that file's header, and
-- "Development seed vs. production bootstrap" in DEPLOYMENT.md, for why
-- these are two files rather than two modes of one.
--
-- Populates the full 7-person roster plus ~30–45 days of realistic activity
-- history, comments, and kudos, so the app can be developed against
-- something that looks and behaves like real usage. Relative dates
-- (current_date - N) are used throughout instead of hardcoded calendar
-- dates, so this seed never goes stale no matter when it's applied.
--
-- Roster, activity taxonomy, and relative activity levels intentionally
-- match the story already established in PRODUCT.md — same 7 people, same
-- "Vivek is most active, Vishakha is least active" shape.

-- realistic-looking placeholders that exist only to satisfy the `email not
-- null unique` constraint before claiming; claiming overwrites them with
